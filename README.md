## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

- My motivation was to create a social network API where users can add and remove friends, add thoughts and reactions. 

- I build this project to practice my knew skills and knowledges. Also I would like to develop this application more in the future. 

- This application solce a problem of keeping and tracking friend list, users, thoughts, and reactions. Potentially this application could grow into a bigger project.
